### Task Breakdown by User Story

| User Story                  | Priority | Task Count | Independent Test                                         |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| US1: CI/CD Reliability      | P1       | 24         | Run `pytest tests/` - completes <5 min, ≥60% coverage    |
| US2: Hardware Protection    | P2       | 29         | Simulate 85°C - system reduces workload, resumes at 80°C |
| US3: Connection Reliability | P3       | 42         | Disconnect WebSocket - reconnects <10s, session restored |
| Infrastructure              | -        | 12         | Setup + Foundational tasks                               |

### Parallelization Analysis

**Parallelizable Tasks**: 47 tasks marked with [P] (37.6% of total)

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**:

1. **Within Phases**:

   - Setup (Phase 1): 8 tasks can run in parallel (directory creation)
   - Foundational (Phase 2): 3 investigation tasks in parallel
   - User Story 1: 6 unit tests in parallel (after implementation)
   - User Story 2: 6 unit tests in parallel (after implementation)
   - User Story 3: 6 unit tests + data structures in parallel
   - Polish (Phase 6): 7 documentation + 8 validation tasks in parallel

2. **Cross-Story Parallelism** (HIGHEST IMPACT):
   - After Foundational phase (T012), all 3 user stories can proceed in parallel
   - 95 tasks across US1/US2/US3 can be distributed to 3 developers
   - Enables completion in 1-2 weeks vs 3-4 weeks sequential

**Parallel Execution Example**:

```bash
# After T012 completes, launch all stories:
# Developer A: T013-T036 (User Story 1 - Thread Cleanup)
# Developer B: T037-T065 (User Story 2 - Thermal Protection)
# Developer C: T066-T107 (User Story 3 - WebSocket Lifecycle)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Strategy 1: MVP First (Fastest CI/CD Unblock)

**Goal**: Unblock CI/CD pipelines as quickly as possible

**Execution**:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T008) - 1 day
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T009-T012) - 0.5 day
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 ONLY (T013-T036) - 3-5 days
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test suite <5 min, coverage ≥60%
5. **MERGE to main** - CI/CD unblocked!

**Timeline**: 5-7 days  
**Value**: Immediate developer productivity improvement, automated testing enabled

**Defer**: User Stories 2 (P2) and 3 (P3) to later sprints

### Strategy 2: Incremental Delivery (Balanced)

**Goal**: Deliver each user story independently as value increments

**Execution**:

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T012) - 1-2 days
2. Deliver User Story 1 (P1) → Test → **Merge** - 3-5 days
3. Deliver User Story 2 (P2) → Test → **Merge** - 4-6 days
4. Deliver User Story 3 (P3) → Test → **Merge** - 5-7 days
5. Complete Polish (T108-T125) → Final validation - 2-3 days

**Timeline**: 15-23 days (3-4 weeks)  
**Value**: Each merge adds new capability without breaking existing features

**Benefits**: Lower risk, continuous integration, early feedback

### Strategy 3: Parallel Team (Fastest Overall)

**Goal**: Complete all user stories simultaneously with team of 3+

**Execution**:

1. **Week 1**: All team members complete Setup + Foundational together (T001-T012)
2. **Week 2-3**: Split team across user stories
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T013-T036)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T037-T065)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T066-T107)
3. **Week 3-4**: Merge stories one by one (P1 → P2 → P3), resolve conflicts
4. **Week 4**: Complete Polish together (T108-T125)

**Timeline**: 14-21 days (2-3 weeks)  
**Value**: Fastest completion, all features delivered together

**Requirements**: 3 developers available, good coordination

## Suggested MVP Scope

**Recommendation**: User Story 1 (P1) ONLY

**Rationale**:

- Highest priority (blocking issue for CI/CD)
- Fastest to implement (24 tasks, 3-5 days)
- Clear acceptance criteria (test suite <5 min)
- Immediate developer productivity impact
- Independent of other stories (no dependencies)

**MVP Tasks**: T001-T036 (Setup + Foundational + User Story 1)  
**MVP Timeline**: 5-7 days  
**MVP Value**: CI/CD pipelines unblocked, automated testing enabled

**Defer to Phase 2.1**: User Story 2 (Thermal Protection)  
**Defer to Phase 2.2**: User Story 3 (WebSocket Lifecycle)

## Next Actions

### Immediate Next Step

**Option A: MVP First (Recommended)**

```bash
# Start with User Story 1 (Thread Cleanup) only
# Begin implementation at T001 (Setup phase)
```

**Option B: Parallel Development**

```bash
# Assign developers to different user stories
# All begin at T001 (Setup phase together)
# Then split at T013 (US1), T037 (US2), T066 (US3)
```

### Before Starting Implementation

1. ✅ Review tasks.md with team
2. ✅ Confirm MVP scope (US1 only vs all 3 stories)
3. ✅ Assign tasks to developers (if parallel approach)
4. ✅ Set up task tracking (GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.)
5. ✅ Create feature branch: `002-test-thermal-websocket` (already exists)

### During Implementation

- Check off tasks in tasks.md as completed
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at checkpoints to validate story independently
- Document any deviations or learnings
- Update tasks.md if scope changes

### After Implementation

1. Complete all validation tasks (T108-T125)
2. Verify all 15 success criteria met
3. Generate Phase 2 completion report
4. Merge to main branch
5. Tag release: `v0.2.0`
