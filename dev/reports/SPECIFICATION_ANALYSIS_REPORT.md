## Detailed Findings

### C1: Coverage Target Consistency (MEDIUM)

**Locations:**

- spec.md: "Target: 60% code coverage minimum" (L27)
- constitution.md: "60% minimum for personal, 80% for production" (Principle 5)

**Issue:** Specification doesn't differentiate coverage targets by deployment type as constitution requires.

**Impact:** Could cause confusion about coverage expectations for production deployment phases.

**Current State:** Phase 1 targets personal deployment (60%), which is correct, but not explicitly stated.

**Recommendation:**

```markdown
# In spec.md, update to:

- Target: 60% code coverage minimum (personal deployment)
- Production deployment: 80% code coverage target (future phases)
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Affects future phase planning

---

### A1: Temperature Detection Behavior Underspecified (LOW)

**Location:** spec.md:L48

**Quote:** "Critical for Pi 5 throttling detection"

**Issue:** Specification states temperature monitoring is "critical" but doesn't specify what action occurs when throttling is detected (75°C warning, 80°C critical).

**Current State:**

- Monitoring implemented ✅
- Temperature thresholds defined ✅
- Health status changes to "unhealthy" ✅
- No automatic action specified ⚠️

**Impact:** System passively reports temperature but doesn't take corrective action.

**Recommendation:**

```markdown
# Add to spec.md thermal thresholds section:

- At 75°C: Log WARNING, continue operation
- At 80°C: System status = "unhealthy", log CRITICAL
- At 85°C (optional Phase 2): Reduce LLM workload or pause processing
```

**Priority:** LOW - Monitoring works, enhancement for Phase 2

---

### G1: Unicode Edge Case Testing Gap (LOW)

**Location:** spec.md:L210-215

**Specified:**

```markdown
4. **Unicode and Special Characters**
   - Emoji in text input: Preserve (Unicode is allowed)
   - Null bytes (`\x00`): Strip (security risk)
   - Invalid UTF-8 sequences: Replace with Unicode replacement character `�`
```

**Issue:** Edge cases specified but no explicit test task in T013-T022.

**Current State:**

- Pydantic validators handle unicode ✅
- No explicit test coverage for edge cases ⚠️

**Impact:** Functionality works but not validated by tests.

**Recommendation:**

```markdown
# Add to tasks.md Phase 3 (or create Phase 2 test enhancement):

- [ ] T023 [P] [US1] Add unicode edge case tests to test_security_validators.py
  - Test emoji preservation
  - Test null byte stripping
  - Test invalid UTF-8 handling
  - Test unicode normalization
```

**Priority:** LOW - Functionality implemented, testing enhancement

---

### D1: Temperature Threshold Duplication (LOW)

**Locations:**

- spec.md:L55-58 (inline in metrics section)
- spec.md:L66-73 ("Thermal Thresholds" subsection)

**Issue:** Same information documented twice with slight variations.

**Impact:** Potential for inconsistency if one location updated without the other.

**Recommendation:** Consolidate into single authoritative location (keep L66-73 detailed version, reference from L55-58).

**Priority:** LOW - Documentation cleanup

---

### T1: Terminology Inconsistency (LOW)

**Locations:**

- tasks.md T028: "vcgencmd for Pi 5"
- spec.md: "Read from `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp` or `vcgencmd measure_temp`"

**Issue:** Tasks specify vcgencmd only, spec mentions both methods.

**Current Implementation:** Uses both with fallback chain ✅

**Recommendation:** Update T028 description to match spec: "Read from /sys/class/thermal or vcgencmd (with fallback)"

**Priority:** LOW - Implementation correct, documentation alignment

---

### U1: Optional Authentication Underspecified (MEDIUM)

**Location:** spec.md Section 1.3 Security Basics

**Mentioned:** "Optional authentication for internet-exposed deployments"

**Tasks:** No T0XX tasks for authentication implementation

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECTLY DEFERRED** per constitution Principle 3 (Security is deployment-dependent)

**Rationale:**

- Phase 1 targets personal/offline deployment
- Authentication not needed for localhost-only use
- Deferred to Phase 2+ for internet-exposed deployments

**Impact:** None - This is intentional and aligned with constitution.

**Recommendation:** No action needed. Document in Phase 2 spec when internet deployment is targeted.

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Important to clarify this is intentional deferral, not an oversight

---

## Unmapped Tasks

**Infrastructure Tasks (No Direct Requirement):**

- T001-T007 (Setup): Directory structure, dependencies
- T008 (conftest.py): Test infrastructure enabler
- T038-T042 (Polish): Validation and quality gates

**Assessment:** ✅ These are legitimate implementation tasks that support requirements. No orphaned tasks detected.

### Phase 2 Technical Debt

**From TEST_SUITE_KNOWN_ISSUES.md:**

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Fix thread cleanup in `turndetect.py`

   - Enable full test suite execution without hanging
   - Implement proper `__del__` method for thread cleanup
   - Add context manager support

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Generate complete coverage report

   - After test suite fix is complete
   - Validate ≥60% coverage achievement
   - Generate HTML coverage report

3. **LOW PRIORITY:** Add pytest-xdist for test isolation
   - Enable parallel test execution
   - Prevent test interference
   - Improve CI/CD performance

---

## Remediation Options

### Option A: No Action (Recommended)

**Accept current specification as-is** and proceed to Phase 2 implementation.

**Rationale:**

- All issues are LOW or MEDIUM severity
- No blocking problems
- Implementation already complete and functional
- Improvements can be incorporated into Phase 2 planning

**Next Command:** Begin Phase 2 planning with `/speckit.specify` for next feature

---

### Option B: Apply Optional Refinements

**Update specification documents** to address the 6 identified issues.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **spec.md** - Add coverage target differentiation (C1)
2. **spec.md** - Add temperature behavior specification (A1)
3. **spec.md** - Consolidate threshold documentation (D1)
4. **tasks.md** - Standardize terminology in T028 (T1)
5. **tasks.md** - Add unicode test task (G1)
6. **spec.md** - Add clarification note for U1 (intentional deferral)

**Effort:** ~30 minutes  
**Impact:** Improved specification clarity for future reference
