# Manual Browser Testing Guide - Phase 2 P3 WebSocket Lifecycle

**Test Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Tester**: Tom  
**Tasks**: T106-T107 Manual Browser Validation  
**Purpose**: Verify WebSocket reconnection, session persistence, and UI indicators in real browser environment

---

## Pre-Test Setup

### 1. Start the Test Server

**Note**: Due to scipy compatibility issues with the full voice processing server on Python 3.13/macOS ARM, use the minimal test server instead.

```bash
cd /Users/Tom/dev-projects/RealtimeVoiceChat
source venv/bin/activate
python test_server.py
```

**Expected Output**:

```
üß™ WebSocket Lifecycle Test Server
üìç Server will start on: http://localhost:8000
üîó WebSocket endpoint: ws://localhost:8000/ws
üíö Health check: http://localhost:8000/health
‚úÖ SessionManager initialized
‚úÖ Background cleanup task started
Session cleanup task started (interval: 60s)
Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### 2. Verify Health Endpoint

Open in browser or curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T...",
  "session_manager": {
    "active_sessions": 0,
    "total_created": 0,
    "total_expired": 0
  }
}
```

## Test Suite

### T106: WebSocket Reconnection Testing

#### Test 1.1: Initial Connection with New Session

**Steps**:

1. Open browser to `http://localhost:8000`
2. Open DevTools Console (Cmd+Option+J on macOS)
3. Look for connection logs

**Expected Behavior**:

- ‚úÖ Status indicator shows "Connecting..." (orange)
- ‚úÖ Status changes to "Connected" (green)
- ‚úÖ Console log: `WebSocket connected successfully`
- ‚úÖ Console log: `Session ID: <uuid>`
- ‚úÖ No `session_id` in localStorage initially (check Application tab ‚Üí Local Storage)
- ‚úÖ After connection, `session_id` saved to localStorage

**Screenshot/Notes**:

```
[ ] Status indicator color correct
[ ] Console logs present
[ ] localStorage session_id saved
[ ] No errors in console
```

---

#### Test 1.2: Connection with Existing Session

**Steps**:

1. Keep browser tab open from Test 1.1 (session_id in localStorage)
2. Refresh page (Cmd+R)
3. Observe connection process

**Expected Behavior**:

- ‚úÖ Status shows "Connecting..." ‚Üí "Connected"
- ‚úÖ Console log: `Attempting to restore session: <same-uuid-as-before>`
- ‚úÖ Console log: `Session restored successfully`
- ‚úÖ Same `session_id` in localStorage (no new ID generated)
- ‚úÖ Connection completes within 2 seconds

**Screenshot/Notes**:

```
[ ] Session ID matches previous test
[ ] "Session restored" message appears
[ ] No new session created (check health endpoint)
[ ] Fast reconnection (<2s)
```

---

#### Test 1.3: Simulate Network Disconnect (DevTools Offline Mode)

**Steps**:

1. With connected WebSocket, open DevTools Network tab
2. Enable "Offline" mode (dropdown at top of Network tab)
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. Disable "Offline" mode
5. Observe reconnection behavior

**Expected Behavior**:

- ‚úÖ Status changes: "Connected" ‚Üí "Disconnected" (red)
- ‚úÖ Status changes: "Disconnected" ‚Üí "Reconnecting..." (orange)
- ‚úÖ Console shows exponential backoff attempts:
  - Attempt 1: 1 second delay
  - Attempt 2: 2 second delay
  - Attempt 3: 4 second delay
- ‚úÖ When back online, status ‚Üí "Connected" (green)
- ‚úÖ Console log: `Reconnected successfully`
- ‚úÖ Same `session_id` preserved in localStorage

**Screenshot/Notes**:

```
[ ] Disconnect detected immediately
[ ] Exponential backoff visible in console
[ ] Backoff delays match: 1s, 2s, 4s...

  - Attempts 1-5: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
  - Attempts 6-10: 30s, 30s, 30s, 30s, 30s
- ‚úÖ After 10 attempts, status ‚Üí "Reconnect Failed" (red)
- ‚úÖ Console log: `Max reconnection attempts reached`
- ‚úÖ When back online, manual reconnect required OR page refresh
- ‚úÖ After refresh, session restored (if <5 minutes elapsed)

**Screenshot/Notes**:

```
[ ] Backoff caps at 30 seconds
[ ] Max attempts = 10
[ ] Clear failure message displayed
[ ] Session restoration works after manual reconnect
```

#### Test 1.5: Multiple Disconnect/Reconnect Cycles

**Steps**:

1. Connected WebSocket
2. Toggle offline mode 5 times with 5-second intervals:
   - Offline ‚Üí wait 5s ‚Üí Online ‚Üí wait 5s ‚Üí repeat
3. Observe session persistence

**Expected Behavior**:

- ‚úÖ Each disconnect triggers reconnection logic
- ‚úÖ Backoff resets after successful reconnection

2. Note `session_id` in Chrome's localStorage
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in Firefox (or Safari)
4. Note `session_id` in Firefox's localStorage
5. Compare session IDs

**Expected Behavior**:

- ‚úÖ Different `session_id` in each browser (localStorage is browser-specific)
- ‚úÖ Both sessions active simultaneously (check health endpoint)
- ‚úÖ Each browser maintains its own session independently
- ‚úÖ No cross-contamination of session data

**Screenshot/Notes**:

```
[ ] Chrome session_id: __________

4. Wait 6 minutes (for cleanup + expiration)
5. Check health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
6. Open new connection

**Expected Behavior**:

- ‚úÖ Health endpoint after 6 minutes:
  - `active_sessions: 0` (all expired and cleaned up)
  - `total_expired: 3` (or cumulative count)
- ‚úÖ Background cleanup task logs visible in server console
- ‚úÖ New connection creates new session (old ones purged)

**Screenshot/Notes**:

```

   - Reconnecting phase
   - Reconnection success
   - Reconnection failure (after 10 attempts)

**Expected Status States**:
| State | Color | Text | CSS Class |
|-------|-------|------|-----------|
| Connecting | üü† Orange | "Connecting..." | `.status-connecting` |
| Connected | üü¢ Green | "Connected" | `.status-connected` |
| Disconnected | üî¥ Red | "Disconnected" | `.status-disconnected` |
| Reconnecting (Attempt 1) | üü† Orange | "Reconnecting... (1/10)" | `.status-reconnecting` |
