# Tasks: Phase 2 Infrastructure Improvements

**Branch**: `002-test-thermal-websocket`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-test-thermal-websocket/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1: Thread Cleanup, P2: Thermal Protection, P3: WebSocket Lifecycle) to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1=P1, US2=P2, US3=P3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create directory structure and initialize new modules for Phase 2 features

- [ ] T001 Create `src/utils/` directory for lifecycle management utilities
- [ ] T002 Create `src/monitoring/` directory for thermal monitoring components
- [ ] T003 Create `src/websocket/` directory for session management

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1/P1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can proceed independently
- **User Story 2/P2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can proceed independently (parallel with US1)
- **User Story 3/P3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can proceed independently (parallel with US1, US2)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Thread Cleanup)**: No dependencies on other stories - Highest priority, blocking for CI/CD
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Thermal Protection)**: No dependencies on other stories - Independent hardware protection feature
- **User Story 3 (P3 - WebSocket Lifecycle)**: No dependencies on other stories - Independent connection reliability feature

### Within Each User Story

1. Create ManagedThread class (T013-T016)
2. Refactor TurnDetector to use ManagedThread (T017-T022)
3. Add unit tests (T023-T028) - can run parallel
4. Add integration tests (T029-T032)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks T001-T008 can run in parallel (different directories)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T010-T012 can run in parallel (investigation tasks)

**Phase 3 (US1)**:

- T013 (ManagedThread) can be independent
- T023-T028 (unit tests) can run in parallel after T013-T022 complete

**Phase 4 (US2)**:

- T037 (ThermalState) independent
- T039 (ThermalMonitor class shell) independent
- T054-T059 (unit tests) can run in parallel after T037-T047 complete

**Phase 5 (US3)**:

- T066-T067 (data structures) can run in parallel
- T086 (backoff utility) independent
- T095-T100 (unit tests) can run in parallel after T066-T086 complete

**Phase 6 (Polish)**: Tasks T108-T114 can run in parallel (documentation), T115-T122 can run in parallel (validation)

**Cross-Story Parallelism**: After Phase 2 (Foundational) completes, all three user stories (Phase 3, 4, 5) can proceed in parallel with separate team members

---

## Parallel Example: All User Stories Together

```bash
# After Foundational phase (T001-T012) completes, launch all user stories in parallel:

# Developer A: User Story 1 (Thread Cleanup)
Task T013: "Create ManagedThread class in src/utils/lifecycle.py"
Task T017: "Refactor TurnDetector in src/turndetect.py"

# Developer B: User Story 2 (Thermal Protection)
Task T037: "Create ThermalState in src/monitoring/thermal_monitor.py"
Task T039: "Create ThermalMonitor in src/monitoring/thermal_monitor.py"

# Developer C: User Story 3 (WebSocket Lifecycle)
Task T066: "Create ConnectionState in src/websocket/session_manager.py"
Task T069: "Create SessionManager in src/websocket/session_manager.py"
```
