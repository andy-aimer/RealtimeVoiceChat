## üìù Specification Summary

**Feature**: Phase 2 Infrastructure Improvements  
**Short Name**: test-thermal-websocket  
**Spec File**: `/Users/Tom/dev-projects/RealtimeVoiceChat/specs/002-test-thermal-websocket/spec.md`

### Scope Overview

Phase 2 addresses three critical infrastructure improvements identified during Phase 1 completion:

1. **P1 - CI/CD Reliability** (Thread Cleanup): Fix test suite hanging issue to enable automated testing
2. **P2 - Hardware Protection** (Thermal Workload Reduction): Implement automatic CPU temperature management at 85¬∞C
3. **P3 - Connection Reliability** (WebSocket Lifecycle): Add graceful disconnection/reconnection handling

### User Stories (Prioritized)

| Priority | Story                  | Value                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| P1       | CI/CD Reliability      | Unblocks automated testing and CI/CD pipelines  |
| P2       | Hardware Protection    | Protects Raspberry Pi 5 from thermal damage     |
| P3       | Connection Reliability | Improves user experience for remote deployments |

### Functional Requirements by Priority

**Thread Cleanup (P1)**: 5 requirements

- FR-001 to FR-005: Thread lifecycle, test suite execution, coverage generation

**Thermal Workload Reduction (P2)**: 7 requirements

- FR-006 to FR-012: Temperature monitoring, workload reduction, auto-recovery, configuration

**WebSocket Lifecycle (P3)**: 7 requirements

- FR-013 to FR-019: Disconnection detection, reconnection strategy, session persistence, health checks

### Success Criteria by Category

**Thread Cleanup**: 5 metrics

- Test suite completion <5 minutes (100% success rate)
- CI pipeline reliability (no timeouts)
- Coverage ‚â•60% with automatic reporting
- Zero orphaned threads
- 50% execution time improvement

**Thermal Protection**: 5 metrics

- Protection trigger within 10 seconds at 85¬∞C
- Temperature cap at 87¬∞C (2¬∞C safety margin)
- Auto-recovery within 30 seconds at 80¬∞C
- Zero hardware damage during stress testing
- Clear user notifications

**WebSocket Reliability**: 5 metrics

- 95% automatic recovery from <60s disconnections
- 100% session preservation for <5 minute disconnections
- Graceful degradation with clear error messages
- 90% reconnection success within 10 seconds
- Zero data loss during disconnect/reconnect

## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### Initial Decisions (No Clarification Needed)

1. **Thermal Workload Reduction Strategy**: Binary on/off at 85¬∞C for simplicity (can enhance to gradual later)
2. **WebSocket Session Persistence**: 5-minute timeout based on industry standards
3. **Thread Cleanup Approach**: Both context managers (tests) and explicit cleanup (production)

### Rationale

- Phase 1 completion provides clear context for requirements
- Test hanging issue is well-documented (TEST_SUITE_KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
- Thermal behavior already specified in refined Phase 1 spec (85¬∞C trigger)
- WebSocket standards (RFC 6455) provide clear guidance

## üìê Specification Structure

### Sections Completed

‚úÖ **User Scenarios & Testing** (mandatory)

- 3 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- Independent testability for each story
- Edge cases identified

‚úÖ **Requirements** (mandatory)

- 19 functional requirements organized by priority
- 3 key entities (TurnDetector, ThermalMonitor, WebSocketSession)
- Clear dependencies and constraints

‚úÖ **Success Criteria** (mandatory)

- 15 measurable outcomes across 3 categories
- Quantitative metrics (time, percentage, temperature)
- Qualitative measures (user feedback, graceful degradation)

‚úÖ **Supporting Sections**

## üîç Quality Assurance

### No Implementation Details

‚úÖ Specification focuses on **WHAT** and **WHY**, not **HOW**

- Requirements describe capabilities, not solutions
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- Dependencies section mentions tech only for context

### Constitution Alignment

‚úÖ All constitutional principles considered:

- **Offline-First**: No external dependencies for core functionality
- **Reliability**: Thread cleanup, thermal protection, reconnection logic
- **Observability**: All actions logged with appropriate levels
- **Security**: Session management with timeout, no data leakage
- **Maintainability**: Files <300 lines constraint documented
- **Testability**: All requirements testable, 60% coverage target

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

**Option 1: Run Clarifications** (Optional)

```bash
# If you want to review/refine the specification further
# (Recommended if stakeholders need to validate scope)
/speckit.clarify
```

**Option 2: Generate Implementation Plan** (Recommended)

```bash
# Ready to proceed - specification is complete
/speckit.plan
```

### Workflow Sequence

1. ‚úÖ **Specify** - COMPLETE (this step)
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Clarify** - Optional (no ambiguities remaining)
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Plan** - Next step (generate implementation plan)
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Task** - Generate detailed task breakdown
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Implement** - Execute Phase 2 development
