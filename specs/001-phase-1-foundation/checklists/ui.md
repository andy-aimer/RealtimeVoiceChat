# UI/Interface Requirements Quality Checklist

**Feature:** 001-phase-1-foundation  
**Type:** UI/Interface Requirements Quality Review  
**Purpose:** Validate completeness, clarity, and consistency of all user-facing interface requirements (API responses, observability UX, developer experience)  
**Depth:** Lightweight (author self-review)  
**Created:** 2025-10-18

---

## Overview

This checklist validates the **quality of requirements** for all user-facing interfaces in Phase 1 Foundation:

- API endpoint responses (`/health`, `/metrics`)
- Error messages and validation responses
- Structured logging output
- Monitoring metrics naming and format
- Developer-facing documentation

**Remember:** This checklist tests whether requirements are well-written, NOT whether implementation works correctly.

## Usage Notes

**This is NOT a verification checklist.** Do NOT use this to test implementation. Instead, use it to validate:

- ✅ Are requirements complete and unambiguous?
- ✅ Can requirements be objectively verified?
- ✅ Are requirements consistent across documents?
- ✅ Are all scenarios and edge cases addressed?

**Lightweight Review Process:**

1. Read each item as a question about the requirements
2. Check spec.md, contracts/, and related docs
3. Mark items that reveal gaps, ambiguities, or conflicts
4. Update requirements to address issues found
5. Re-run checklist to verify improvements

**Next Steps:**

- Address high-priority gaps (security, performance, edge cases)
- Clarify ambiguous terms with specific measurements
- Resolve conflicts between requirements
- Update contracts to match spec changes
