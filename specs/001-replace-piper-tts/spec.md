# Feature Specification: Replace RealtimeTTS with Piper TTS

**Feature Branch**: `001-replace-piper-tts`  
**Created**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "remove realtimetts[coqui,kokoro,orpheus] and replace with piper TTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Voice Response with Piper TTS (Priority: P1)

Users interact with the voice chat system and receive spoken responses generated by Piper TTS instead of RealtimeTTS engines. The voice quality and response timing remain consistent with current user experience expectations.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that directly impacts every user interaction with text-to-speech. Essential for maintaining the primary voice chat feature while improving system reliability and reducing dependencies.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending text input through the chat interface and verifying that audio response is generated using Piper TTS with acceptable quality and timing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user sends a text message to the chat system, **When** the system processes the response, **Then** audio output is generated using Piper TTS engine
2. **Given** system generates a response longer than 100 characters, **When** TTS processing occurs, **Then** audio streaming begins within 2 seconds
3. **Given** user sends multiple rapid messages, **When** system queues TTS requests, **Then** each response is processed in order without audio overlap

### User Story 2 - Voice Configuration Options (Priority: P2)

Users can select from available Piper TTS voices to customize their chat experience, replacing the previous Coqui/Kokoro/Orpheus engine selection.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience by providing voice customization, but system functions fully without it. Can be implemented after core TTS replacement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing voice settings and switching between available Piper voices, then verifying the audio output reflects the selected voice characteristics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses voice settings, **When** they view available voices, **Then** system displays list of available Piper TTS voices
2. **Given** user selects a different Piper voice, **When** they save settings, **Then** subsequent TTS output uses the selected voice
3. **Given** user switches voices during an active conversation, **When** new response is generated, **Then** audio uses the newly selected voice without system restart

### User Story 3 - Performance Monitoring and Fallbacks (Priority: P3)

System administrators can monitor TTS performance metrics and the system gracefully handles Piper TTS failures with appropriate fallbacks or error messaging.

**Why this priority**: Important for system reliability and maintenance, but not essential for basic functionality. Users can still use core features without advanced monitoring.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by monitoring system logs during TTS operations and intentionally triggering failure conditions to verify fallback behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Piper TTS service is unavailable, **When** user requests voice response, **Then** system provides clear error message and continues chat functionality without crashing
2. **Given** system is processing TTS requests, **When** administrator checks system metrics, **Then** TTS processing time and success rate are logged and accessible
3. **Given** Piper TTS generates corrupted audio, **When** system detects the issue, **Then** system retries once and logs the failure for review

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Piper TTS model files are missing or corrupted during startup?
- How does system handle text containing special characters, emojis, or non-English content that Piper may not support?
- What occurs when multiple users request TTS simultaneously and system resources are constrained?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all RealtimeTTS engine dependencies (Coqui, Kokoro, Orpheus) from codebase and requirements
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate Piper TTS engine as the primary text-to-speech provider
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain existing TTS API interface to ensure compatibility with current audio processing workflow
- **FR-004**: System MUST support at least 3 different Piper TTS voices for user selection
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve audio streaming capabilities with comparable latency to current RealtimeTTS implementation
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle Piper TTS failures gracefully without crashing the application
- **FR-007**: System MUST update configuration files to replace RealtimeTTS engine settings with Piper-specific options
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to switch between available Piper voices through existing voice configuration interface
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing audio output formats and sample rates
- **FR-010**: System MUST log TTS processing metrics including generation time and success/failure status

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **TTS Engine Configuration**: Piper-specific settings including model paths, voice selections, audio quality parameters, and processing options
- **Voice Profile**: Individual Piper voice characteristics including voice ID, display name, language support, and audio sample rate
- **Audio Output Stream**: Generated audio data with metadata including format, duration, and processing timestamp
- **TTS Request**: Text input with associated voice selection, user context, and processing priority

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users experience TTS response generation within 2 seconds for messages under 200 characters (maintaining current performance expectations)
- **SC-002**: System successfully generates audio for 99% of text inputs without errors or crashes
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully switch between at least 3 different Piper voices with audio output reflecting the change within one response cycle
- **SC-004**: System startup time increases by no more than 3 seconds compared to current RealtimeTTS implementation
- **SC-005**: Memory usage for TTS operations decreases by at least 20% compared to current multi-engine RealtimeTTS setup
- **SC-006**: 100% of current TTS API endpoints continue to function without breaking changes to calling code
- **SC-007**: Zero RealtimeTTS dependencies remain in production deployment after migration completion
