# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 2 Infrastructure Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 19, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASS** - All checklist items satisfied

### Detailed Review:

**Content Quality** - ✅ PASS

- Specification avoids implementation details (Python, threading library mentioned only in Dependencies section)
- Focuses on user/developer value (CI/CD reliability, hardware protection, connection reliability)
- Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness** - ✅ PASS

- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all open questions have initial decisions documented)
- All 19 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous (e.g., FR-001: "properly terminate all background threads")
- All 15 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., SC-001: "under 5 minutes", SC-006: "within 10 seconds")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on outcomes like "test suite completes" not "pytest runs")
- All 3 user stories have acceptance scenarios defined
- 6 edge cases identified with specific scenarios
- Scope clearly bounded with explicit Out of Scope section
- Dependencies (technical + external) and 8 assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness** - ✅ PASS

- All 19 functional requirements link to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 3 prioritized user scenarios (P1, P2, P3) cover primary flows with independent testability
- 15 success criteria provide measurable outcomes for feature success
- No implementation details in functional requirements (all phrased as capabilities, not solutions)

### Notes:

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Open Questions section includes initial decisions to avoid blocking progress
- Priorities clearly defined (P1: Thread Cleanup, P2: Thermal, P3: WebSocket)
- All requirements follow constitutional principles (files <300 lines, offline-first, testability)
- Success criteria include both quantitative (5 minutes, 60% coverage) and qualitative (user feedback, graceful degradation) measures
